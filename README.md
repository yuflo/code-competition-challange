# 3 weeks algorithm training

This project stores the source code and some relevant documents about a 3 weeks algorithm training journey which starts from 2019.01.02 and ends at 2019.01.27. 

The main reference book of this training journey is [挑战程序设计](https://book.douban.com/subject/24749842/) (aliased as `ccc` in this project) which provides basic code materials and training path.

> Good luck & have fun.


## source code id format

>> code-id = chapter-section-index + type + sequence-number

### type
+ `d`: example / demo
+ `e`: homework / exercise
+ `x`: extend

### a simple example
"code-id = 211d1" means the code of 1st example in section 2.1.1 of `ccc`.
